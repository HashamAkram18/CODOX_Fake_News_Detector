I imagine bystanders saw the well-done replica (it even has funky hubcaps) flash by with cop cars in pursuit and wondered if someone was making a movie.Redding.com reports:Shasta County Probation Department officials contacted the Redding Police Department about a subject violating their probation sometime around 12:50 p.m. Sunday. The woman was identified as Sharon Kay Turman, 51, of Redding, Sgt. Ron Icely said in a news release.Officers spotted Turman in a 1994 Chrysler Town and Country minivan at California Shasta streets, but she fled south in the vehicle when officers tried to pull her over, said Icely.Amazingly, the 22-year-old minivan got up to speeds of 100 miles per hour during the pursuit. Even more amazingly, despite having zero concern for the safety of anyone else on the road, Turman managed not to kill anyone, although she did blow through an intersection and almost hit four cars in the process.The police called off their pursuit, presumably to allow Turman to stop fleeing in a blind panic and to avoid a fatal car accident. Instead, they followed her with a helicopter:The CHP helicopter kept surveillance of Turman s vehicle as she continued west toward Highway 36, where she was spotted abandoning the vehicle in northwestern Tehama County. Her whereabouts were unknown Sunday afternoon, police said, but her vehicle was later found and impounded.It s not clear what crime Turman was on probation for but if the police were willing to let her escape rather than risk a fatal accident, it s very likely it wasn t a violent offense.But if you live in or near northwestern Tehama County, keep a look out for empty boxes of Scooby Snacks and this woman:Sharon Kay TurmanTurman is wanted by the Redding police and Shasta County probation. Anyone with information regarding her whereabouts can call the Redding Police Department at (530) 225-4200 or Secret Witness of Shasta County at (530) 243-2319.Featured image via Madidon Wade s KRCR News twitter feed.\",\n          \"Trayvon s dad sounds more logical and  Presidential  than Obama when it comes to discussing the truth about black on black crime. Maybe he wasn t so far off the mark when Obama said Trayvon could be his son?While Trayvon Martin s mother is traipsing around the country as part of Hillary Clinton s pander tour and trying to convince everyone that her sweet little angel was gunned down by a racist system, Trayvon s father actually had something intelligent to say on the issue of race. In defiance of Black Lives Matter, Tracy Martin said that the movement is meaningless as long as blacks continue to kill each other.Tracy Martin was speaking before the 30th Annual Charles W. Kegley Memorial Institute of Ethics at California State Bakersfield on Tuesday when he uttered the words that will drive BLM into a frenzy. We gonna keep killing one another. I tell people all the time that we are committing genocide,  said Martin.And then here s the thing that if a white guy said it would be considered the most racist statement ever: We re on the brink of extinction at the way these shootings and killings are going on. We keep the funeral homes and the penal system in business. When are we going to wake up? I m a realist. We can t sit up and scream that black lives matter at any other ethnicity group if Black lives don t matter to Black people,  he said.This is what I find interesting here: Black Lives Matter is a movement that was created because of Trayvon Martin s death and it is a fact that the black activists get super-pissed off when anyone suggests that black-on-black violence is more of a pressing issue than hyped up and fictionalized racism. But this is the father of the person who spawned the movement saying that blacks killing blacks is the real problem. Something s gotta give.This could cause the movement to collapse on itself, creating a racism supernova that neither race-hustling nor manufactured outrage can escape.Unfortunately not everything that Tracy Martin said was as spot-on as his black-on-black crime observation. He said the way he wanted Trayvon to be remembered was,  not as the iconic image of the hoodie, but as the African-American boy who galvanized the country. To galvanize generally means uniting people to action behind a common cause. That is the complete opposite of what Trayvon Martin s death did to this country. Besides birthing the BLM movement, the Trayvon Martin shooting and subsequent trial divided this nation along racial lines at ten times the rate of Barack Obama s efforts.Though he wouldn t use the name of the man who defended his life against a violent attack by his son, Tracy Martin characterized George Zimmerman as  guilty  and   the man who pulled the trigger and killed an innocent. And then there s this: Trust me when I say that white America can t survive without Black America,  said Martin.Never trust someone who says  trust me  they are always lying.I know that when other black celebrities have spoken on the issue of black-on-black violence, they have been shouted down by the black activists and labeled  Uncle Toms.  It will be interesting to see how the black outrage machine deals with Tracy Martin, father of the father of Black Lives Matter, saying that black lives have to first matter to black people before they will mater to anyone else. Via: Downtrend\",\n          \"Over the weekend, the Trump Administration implemented one of their most terrifying campaign promises, the Muslim ban. He did it via Executive Order, and framed it as a  travel ban  from seven supposedly  dangerous  Muslim-majority countries. When Trump s hammer dropped, scores of people were detained and questioned for no good reason in airports and other ports of entry around the nation. Many were legal residents, green card holders, those with legal visas and refugee status, and other people who had been thoroughly vetted and had every right to enter this country without incident.The backlash was swift, as protests erupted organically and in massive numbers at major airports everywhere. The ACLU asked for lawyers to volunteer to help these people, and they did. Finally, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donelly issued an emergency stay on Trump s racist travel ban, but it still took hours to get customs officers and border patrol agents to comply. Well, now Trump has been hit with another blow to his bigoted order, as Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly has issued a statement saying that those with legal residency will not be kept from entering this nation. The statement reads:WASHINGTON   In applying the provisions of the president s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.So there, Trump. I dare you to try to go around Homeland Security and reverse this provision. What you and your administration are doing is unconstitutional, and, more importantly, it is un-American. Now, listen to the Homeland Security Secretary, and to everyone else who is telling you that this is unlawful and wrong, and stop this bullshit.Hopefully, if the sycophants around Trump won t pull the trigger and stop this madness, the Constitution will hold, and we can somehow stop this crazy agenda via the law.

              "'WEST PALM BEACH, Fla (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believes he will be fairly treated in a special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, but said he did not know how long the probe would last. The federal investigation has hung over Trump’s White House since he took office almost a year ago, and some Trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased against the Republican president. But in an interview with the New York Times, Trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation, which was prompted by U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda. “There’s been no collusion. But I think he’s going to be fair,” Trump said in what the Times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mueller has charged four Trump associates in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by Mueller’s team. Trump’s lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the Mueller investigation to wrap up quickly, possibly by the end of 2017. Mueller has not commented on how long it will last. Trump told the Times that he did not know how long the investigation would take. “Timing-wise, I can’t tell you. I just don’t know,” he said. Trump said he thought a prolonged probe “makes the country look bad” but said it has energized his core supporters. “What it’s done is, it’s really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is strong than it’s ever been,” he said. The interview was a rare break in Trump’s Christmas vacation in Florida. He has golfed each day aside from Christmas Day, and mainly kept a low profile, apart from the occasional flurry of tweets. He spent one day golfing with Republican Senator David Perdue from Georgia, who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers, and had dinner on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, an international trade hawk. Trump told the Times he hoped to work with Democrats in the U.S. Congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure, and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Trump spoke about trade issues, saying he had backed off his hard line on Chinese trade practices in the hope that Beijing would do more to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. He said he had been disappointed in the results. He also complained about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with Mexico and Canada. Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had played down the importance of Canadian oil and lumber exports to the United States when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries. “If I don’t make the right deal, I’ll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But we’re doing pretty good,” Trump said. '"

As expected, it was an embarrassment, and the black community was not fooled by Trump s pandering photo-op.Perhaps one of the mast damning of all criticism comes from across the board religious leaders, all of them black, from the Detroit metropolitan are. They all had the same message for Trump   we aren t fooled.The Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity penned a scathing letter signed by representatives of 10 different Christian denominations on Saturday, blasting the opportunism of the Trump campaign and its brazen language and exploitation:We   have been avoided and overlooked in regards to the upcoming appearance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Detroit   Racism, bigotry, misogyny, hate speech, sexism, divisiveness, threats, a call to harm, discrimination, bullying, and fearmongering have no place in the White House in the greatest country in the world.In addition to the Baptist leadership, representatives from the Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength; the Michigan chapter of Church of God in Christ; the Evangelical Lutheran, and Episcopal Church all signed on.In total, these religious organizations represent over 200 African-American churches in southeastern Michigan alone.The president of the Baptist Pastor s council, Rev. Lawrence Glass, blasted Trump as an insult to the African Americans and minorities, saying his attacks on Muslims, immigrants and Hispanics.Glass also pointed out that Trump  has no history of helping minorities, of going to the inner city to help out people of color  He has done absolutely nothing,  and  He wants us to believe him  He must think we re really, really naive and ignorant of his past practices. Although these churches and their leaders have a huge  disdain  for Trump, they have said that doesn t necessarily mean they re all in for Hillary Clinton.The chairman of Detroit Ecumenical Ministers, the Rev. Horace Sheffield, accused Trump of using blacks as  political props. Trump and his campaign thought they could trick black voters into supporting him by appealing to their religious convictions. Unlike the rabid, faux Christian evangelicals represented by people like Billy Graham and Michele Bachmann, black religious leaders actually follow by example. And Trump certainly does not fit their mold.Here s an important reminder for Trump: the most religious group in America are black women. Black women are also Democratic voters, and for good reason. They aren t so easily tricked by a predatory white nationalist.Another Trump  pivot  gone horribly wrong.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images\",\n          \"Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible. It s like a club you belong to without asking to be part of it, Harrison said.Via: Daily Caller\",\n          \"President-elect @realDonaldTrump s unexpected patience with fools Watch below! #MAGA #Dobbs pic.twitter.com/sRfe2LhkkK  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) December 13, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"June 21, 2016\",\n          \"May 27, 2016 \",\n          \"Aug 27, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The announcement came on the heels of Tuesday\\u2019s elections in Virginia, where Democrats won the governor\\u2019s office and triumphed in local races in some Republican strongholds. Goodlatte has represented Virginia\\u2019s 6th congressional district for 25 years.  He joins a string of Republican lawmakers who have announced their retirements from Congress in recent weeks.  Two other House committee chairmen, Representatives Lamar Smith and Jeb Hensarling, both of Texas, said last week they would not seek re-election. Hensarling leads the House Financial Services Committee, while Smith leads the Science, Space and Technology panel. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Rand Paul said on Thursday that he and three of his fellow Republicans in the Senate oppose the draft healthcare bill put forward by party leaders as it is currently written, potentially imperiling the legislation\\u2019s passage, the Associated Press reported.

What s happened to the Southern leaders? Confederate flags should be placed on the graves of Civil War soldiers. This is way over the top and a knee-jerk reaction to the shooting in Charleston, SC.The House has voted to ban the display of Confederate flags at historic federal cemeteries in the deep South.The low-profile move came late Tuesday after a brief debate on a measure funding the National Park Service, which maintains 14 national cemeteries, most of which contain graves of Civil War soldiers.The proposal by California Democrat Jared Huffman would block the Park Service from allowing private groups from decorating the graves of southern soldiers with Confederate flags in states that commemorate Confederate Memorial Day. The cemeteries affected are the Andersonville and Vicksburg cemeteries in Georgia and Mississippi.Pressure has mounted to ban display of the flag on state and federal property in the wake of last month s tragic murders at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.SELLING CONFEDERATE FLAGS BANNED TOO:The House voted to affirm that stores on federal lands operated by the National Park Service cannot sell Confederate flags, in light of a new policy announced in the aftermath of the shooting in Charleston, S.C.Adoption of the amendment to the 2016 Interior Department appropriations bill came easily on a voice vote after just six minutes of debate, where no one spoke in opposition. The amendment reflects a policy announced by the National Park Service in June to ban the sale of Confederate flag merchandise from its gift shops and bookstores.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), the author of the amendment, said it was important that Congress prevent the sale of the Confederate image on federal property. This House now has an opportunity to add its voice, by ending the promotion of the cruel, racist legacy of the Confederacy,  Huffman said.  While many concessionaires have agreed to do this, I am dismayed by reports that some will continue to sell items with Confederate flag imagery.

Lawmakers also urged British authorities to grant broad rights to EU citizens and their families in Britain after it exits the EU in 2019, an issue where EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday big differences remained. The European Parliament  expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against EU citizens living in the United Kingdom , the draft resolution said.  Lawmakers said there were also cases of British citizens discriminated against in other EU countries. The British government said on Sept. 9 that its Equalities Office (GEO) was  aware of, and is looking into, reports of discrimination against non-UK EU nationals seeking employment  in violation of the 2010 Equality Act. The document, agreed on Thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties, will be voted on by the chamber next week in Strasbourg. The document is not binding on EU negotiators but the 28-nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with Britain on its future relations with the EU. MPs also urged Britain to protect the rights of EU citizens and their children even if they are born there after Brexit.  Future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members,  the document said. EU lawmakers have opposed Britain s proposals to create a new category of  settled status  under United Kingdom immigration law for EU citizens. Differences on these issues remain, Barnier said on Thursday at the end of a fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Without sufficient progress on citizens  rights, the EU will not move on to negotiations on a future trade deal with London. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers released a batch of Russian-bought Facebook Inc ads on Wednesday that showcased politically charged content allegedly spread on social media by Moscow ahead of the 2016 U.S. election.  Some of the ads criticized candidates, while others sought to organize or promote simultaneous rallies for opposite sides of divisive issues. The sample posted on a House committee website pulled from the roughly 3,000 ads Facebook provided to congressional investigators last month.  Tech companies recently acknowledged that Russia-based content on U.S. politics and social issues like gun rights, immigration, religion and race had spread on their platforms before and after the election. Some of the ads sampled specifically dealt with the U.S. election and were critical of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. One from an account called \\u201cArmy of Jesus\\u201d said Clinton was supported by evil forces. \\u201cHillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,\\u201d the post read. It added that Republican candidate Donald Trump was \\u201can honest man\\u201d who \\u201ccares deeply for this country.\\u201d Other ads appeared to be aimed at setting up clashes over hot-button issues.  One ad from a group calling itself \\u201cHeart of Texas\\u201d promoted a rally in Houston on May 21, 2016 to \\u201cStop Islamization\\u201d in the U.S. state. Another ad from a separate Facebook page promoted a pro-Islam rally at the same time and venue. The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the 2016 election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Clinton. The ads were released at a U.S. House Intelligence Committee hearing, where lawyers from Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc\\u2019s Google testified about Russian influence on their networks.  It was the second straight day the companies attempted to ward off criticism from lawmakers that they were slow to respond to Russian abuse. Facebook, the world\\u2019s largest social media network, again came under the most scrutiny from lawmakers, who expressed frustration with the company because of its role in targeted marketing.  Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch told the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on Facebook\\u2019s picture-sharing service Instagram beginning in October 2016. The election was on Nov. 8. An additional four million may have seen such material on Instagram before October, though that data was less complete, Stretch said. The Instagram figures were in addition to the 126 million Americans who may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, a number the company disclosed earlier this week. The companies\\u2019 visit to Washington this week reflected shifting political fortunes for the U.S. tech industry, which after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny is now on the defensive on a range of policy issues. \\u201cIn the past election, you failed,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who normally is considered a strong ally of Silicon Valley. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign, including through social media, to try to influence the vote in favor of Trump.  A U.S. Justice Department special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating Russian meddling and any potential collusion by Trump\\u2019s campaign.  Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow ahead of the election. Democrats and Republicans both said in Wednesday\\u2019s Senate intelligence hearing that the tech companies need to do more to police against foreign government abuse on their platforms. Some Republicans, however, sought to distance that scrutiny from questions about the legitimacy of Trump\\u2019s election victory. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said it was impossible to measure the impact or know the motivation of the Russian operation to spread political material on social media.  Any conclusions that Trump benefited from Russia, perhaps in a decisive way, to win the White House ignored the complexity of the issue, Burr said. \\u201cI\\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily,\\u201d he said. Some Republicans also sought to portray the amount of Russian content as miniscule compared to the total amount of political material online.  The campaigns of Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook ads, Stretch said, compared to about $46,000 in ad buys from the Internet Research Agency, a suspected Russian troll farm. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he was disappointed the companies appeared be confining reviews to information linked to the Internet Research Agency, and suggested there could have been far more undetected Russian content. Some senators criticized the companies for sending lawyers, not chief executives, to testify.  \\u201cIf we go through this exercise again, we would appreciate seeing the top people who are making the decision,\\u201d said Senator Angus King, an independent.  \",\n          \"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s new prime minister faces a difficult balancing act trying to repair bruised relations with the European Union without alienating the eurosceptic government s core voters. A Western-educated former banker who is fluent in German and English and was sworn in on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki boasts the credentials needed to negotiate with Brussels. But any compromises to improve relations with Brussels, which sees the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party as a threat to democracy, would risk upsetting the traditional, Catholic supporters who propelled it into power two years ago. It is a gamble that could backfire, and it is not yet clear how far Morawiecki, 49, and his party, dominated by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are ready to go to please Brussels.   The idea to build up international credibility seems rational,  said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University.  But such actions would have to be in complete contrast with what Mateusz Morawiecki would have to do domestically to prevent the PiS from falling apart.  The PiS government has alienated many people at home and abroad with its nationalist rhetoric and changes to state institutions which the EU says subvert the bloc s laws. The European Commission, the EU executive, opened an inquiry into the rule of law in Poland in January 2016 and the European Parliament has started a process that could deprive Poland of its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc. Any hope in Brussels that Morawiecki s appointment signals a change of course by PiS will have been tempered by Polish parliament approving legal changes to the judiciary in defiance of the EU on Friday - the day after his nomination. The changes give parliament, where PiS has a majority, de facto control over the selection of judges. EU leaders looking for clues about Morawiecki s plans will also have taken little comfort from comments he has made since being nominated, making clear he backs a tough line on the EU and believes in PiS s traditional vision of the Polish state.   We want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-christianise it,  Morawiecki told the Catholic Radio Maryja broadcaster.  We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.  Asked by the radio interviewer about demands by French President Emmanuel Macron for Poland to face sanctions over a subversion of democratic rules, Morawiecki said he would not  bow down to blackmail.  In comments to parliament on Tuesday, Morawiecki suggested Poland might relent in a conflict with Brussels over logging in an ancient forest, which an EU court has said contravenes EU laws. But he said Poland s national interests came first in any debate over the future of the EU and that he  wholeheartedly  supported PiS s overhaul of the judiciary. Like Beata Szydlo, whom he replaced as prime minister, Morawiecki is likely to have to defer to PiS leader and co-founder Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Prime minister from July 2006 to November 2007, Kaczynski is widely seen as the power behind the party and Poland s main decision-maker. How much scope that will leave Morawiecki to carve out his own path remains to be seen. Former Polish President Lech Walesa, a PiS critic, has suggested that nothing of substance will change.  The circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles,  Walesa, who led the Solidarity trade union movement that ended communist rule, said on Twitter.  The appointment of Morawiecki, whose father founded and led a radical offshoot of Solidarity in the 1980s, appears designed in part to present a new face of Poland to the EU. Szydlo, 54, at times responded angrily to EU criticism and relations with the bloc soured under her government. Underlining PiS opposition to Muslim immigration, she said last month Poland wanted to be sure Christian traditions were not subject to  ideological censorship  in the EU. Along with Hungary, Poland has refused to take in any of its quota of the wave of refugees from Syria and elsewhere who have come to Europe since 2015, on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability.         Such comments appeal to core PiS voters, and Szydlo s government, which promised generous welfare payouts and a dedication to traditional Catholic values, was one of Poland s most popular since communist rule ended in 1989. A relative newcomer to politics, Morawiecki lacks Szydlo s broad appeal. But he has overseen significant economic achievements since becoming finance minister in 2016, a position he has retained in the new government. Tusk has welcomed what he sees as signs that Morawiecki is a liberal economist who wants better ties with the EU.  There is no doubt that (Morawiecki s) liberal bias and some pro-western gestures could be a sign that there is a lurking desire to improve relations,  Tusk said last week. But an economic stimulus plan Morawiecki unveiled in 2016 has been criticized by economists who say it depends heavily on private investment, which is low in Poland despite fast economic growth.  What Morawiecki sees as a solution, meaning more political influence in the economy, is actually dangerous,  said Leszek Balcerowicz, a former finance minister who coordinated the transition to a market economy after decades of communist rule. Any hint of protectionism is also likely to worry EU leaders, who seek to break down trade barriers.  Morawiecki has called the privatization of state-owned companies a tragedy and said he will give more power to domestic capital at the expense of foreign investors. In his comments to parliament on Tuesday, he said economic policy should not change.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Enter a news article: The government should publish advice for its departments on engaging with young people, including on TikTok, a group of MPs has said. The culture, media and sport committee has been looking into countering disinformation online. Its call comes despite TikTok currently being banned on government devices due to data security concerns. Accurate information needs to be communicated in a \"relatable\" way, the MPs say. The committee says that countering misinformation is particularly important for young people, who are increasingly turning away from traditional media and towards social media for their information. It advises meeting young people \"where they are\" - with 15 to 24 year olds spending around an hour per day on TikTok, according to media regulator Ofcom. The report says: \"The Government must have a clear strategy for communicating with young people and adapting to the development of new apps and platforms which appeal to this audience.\" Some MPs do still use TikTok, despite the fact it is blocked on the Parliament Wi-Fi network. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has almost 20,000 followers, though he says he does not have the app on his personal phone. \"Grant knows that TikTok can be a valuable tool for communicating with his constituents,\" a source close to Mr Shapps told the BBC in September 2023. The Ministry of Defence also operates a separate account which has about 17,500 followers. TikTok is under pressure in many countries over its links to the Chinese state - links it has always denied - with law-makers in the US recently passing legislation saying it should be sold or banned. It has though endorsed the committee's findings. \"We welcome this report's recommendation that the Government should engage with the public on whatever platform they choose to use\", it said in a statement. The government has responded to the committee report by saying it makes efforts to \"reach people directly on the platforms they spend the most time on.\" It adds that the Online Safety Act, which came into law last year, \"will also help tackle the root cause of disinformation\" by requiring social media companies \"to swiftly remove illegal misinformation and disinformation as soon as they become aware of it.\" But the law was criticised at the time by fact-checking service Full Fact, which said it did not go far enough \"to address the way that platforms treat harmful misinformation and disinformation.\" The MPs took evidence from over 60 different people prior to publishing their report, including disinformation experts and journalists. Among these were BBC journalists Rebecca Skippage and Marianna Spring. Also interviewed were financial journalist Martin Lewis, Channel 4 journalist Georgina Lee and the chief executive of Full Fact Will Moy.\n",

            "Enter a news article: NATO allies on Tuesday welcomed President Donald Trump s decision to commit more forces to Afghanistan, as part of a new U.S. strategy he said would require more troops and funding from America s partners. Having run for the White House last year on a pledge to withdraw swiftly from Afghanistan, Trump reversed course on Monday and promised a stepped-up military campaign against  Taliban insurgents, saying:  Our troops will fight to win .  U.S. officials said he had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. But his speech did not define benchmarks for successfully ending the war that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and which he acknowledged had required an   extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure .  We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troops and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will,  Trump said. That comment signaled he would further increase pressure on U.S. partners who have already been jolted by his repeated demands to step up their contributions to NATO and his description of the alliance as  obsolete  - even though, since taking office, he has said this is no longer the case. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement:  NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with (Defense) Secretary (James) Mattis and our Allies and international partners.  NATO has 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, and 15 countries have pledged more, Stoltenberg said. Britain, a leading NATO member, called the U.S. commitment  very welcome .  In my call with Secretary Mattis yesterday we agreed that despite the challenges, we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy and reduce the terrorist threat to the West,  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. Germany, which has borne the brunt of Trump s criticism over  the scale of its defense spending, also welcomed the new U.S. plan.  Our continued commitment is necessary on the path to stabilizing the country,  a government spokeswoman said. In June, European allies had already pledged more troops but had not given details on numbers, waiting for the Trump administration to outline its strategy for the region.Nearly 16 years after the U.S.-led invasion - a response to the Sept. 11 attacks which were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan - the country is still struggling with weak central government and a Taliban insurgency. Trump said he shared the frustration of the American people who were  weary of war without victory , but a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda to fill.\n",
